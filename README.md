### Purpose:

This is a home task for Revolut job application. 


### How to run?

You can start the main method in Application.kt, or generate a jar with `./gradlew build` the run `java -jar build/libs/revolut-test-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar`.

### Considerations:

- I used Ktor[https://ktor.io/] in webservice layer, using Koin[https://insert-koin.io/] to handle DI. The other parts of application where written mostly in Java.
- For persistence, I used jdbc, using a lib called Jdbi.

- The idea is, when a transaction is created, a new row in balance table is created. It will add or subtract from latest total before operation, then on next operation this new balance will be the source of truth.
- The amount is in cents. Even cryptocurrency would work, handling satoshis in BTC for instance.

*** 
- Yet about transaction, my idea was handle a transaction as an event. Receive a transaction, add a new row and subtract. To handle concurrency I intended to verify asynchronously if the balance is positive or zero.
